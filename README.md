# Hospital-Website

##Overview
Hospital Website built using ReactJs, NodeJs, Express, and MYSQL.
##Description
Application consists of 3 main modules. Admin, Doctor and Patient.
User can only sign up as patient. Admin and Doctor have to be added into system by existing Admin for maximum security.
Patient can book appointments which will then be visible on Doctor's end.
We have also employed input constraints to enhance Parameter sanitization so that clean Data enters the Database.
All technologies were learnt and implemented from scratch within 3 months.

##Plans for the future
We plan to use further more node libraries such as bcrypt,jwt,xss,rate-limit to prevent security from various different types of attacks
and also to implement a more automatic kind of authentication and authorization that is more commonly used in the professional web industry

##PS
This project is the work of 3 university of students. I myself have contributed to this project by implementing the back-end side.
